wavs/23.wav|In the beginning, there was some fundamental reason it was successful.
wavs/24.wav|Our financial performance wasn't as good as our technology and contribution performance.
wavs/25.wav|Now, an ASIC is designed to be application specific.
wavs/26.wav|So I'm super excited about the moment we're in. I want to make sure that we take advantage of it and capitalize on it.
wavs/27.wav|It does nothing, you know, it does exactly that, and it does it very well.
wavs/28.wav|Because of the decisions we made a decade or so ago, and we put so much of our might and expertise into it.
wavs/29.wav|The customers that we have there are consumer companies and consumer internet companies. And the regulation is going to be just fine. We're going to be able to work through it.
wavs/30.wav|In the whole time that we've been making computers more and more capable, the technology became harder and harder to use, and the technology divide arguably has been growing until artificial intelligence.
wavs/31.wav|NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform lets you have versatility and utilization.
wavs/32.wav|Well, as you could tell, I'm sprightly and quite enthusiastic and energetic yet.
wavs/33.wav|It is still true, and you need amazing computer scientists.
wavs/34.wav|When you build an infrastructure, the most important thing for you is utilization.
wavs/35.wav|New, new entire applications that weren't possible before would discover us. This is the nature of cloud. This was the nature of PC. This was the nature of mobile cloud.
wavs/36.wav|And some of them, some great new companies like Google and others got invented during that time.
wavs/37.wav|If you want to start a startup today, it's you and AI.
wavs/38.wav|We saw early on about a decade or so ago that this way of doing software could change everything.
wavs/39.wav|And I remember delivering my very first AI supercomputer. I hand delivered it myself. I delivered it to open AI.
wavs/40.wav|And so I think the ability for every industry to create their foundation model, there's going to be a protein foundation model, a chemical foundation model.
wavs/41.wav|So we're in very powerful systems, and we're in very energy efficient systems.
wavs/42.wav|We're able to serve our customers in China with the regulated parts and delightfully support them.
wavs/43.wav|The world's very first AI supercomputer was delivered to open AI.
wavs/44.wav|And so we started this accelerator company, this accelerated computing company, to solve those problems.
wavs/45.wav|Instead of humans typing in a software program, the data creates the software.
wavs/46.wav|We took what otherwise would be a billion -dollar data center running CPUs, and we shrunk it down into a data center of $100 million.
wavs/47.wav|And it's remained basically the same for the last 25 years.
wavs/48.wav|Some people call it software 2 .0, where the machine augments the software programmers and the data writes the software.
wavs/49.wav|Search and, you know, everything about the situation we're in right now is really about growth and really about getting into the next phase of computing. And AI is at the center of that.
wavs/50.wav|And as a result, if we want to increase the amount of computing throughput we want, and there's no question that's happening, then the amount of power that the world needs in the data center will grow.
wavs/51.wav|It's put technology, very powerful technology, in the hands of anybody who would like to use it.
wavs/52.wav|And so this capability has democratized computing for the very first time.
wavs/53.wav|And so it turned out to have been a fantastic technology driver for our company.
wavs/54.wav|And so as a result, we increased the performance of what may possible ray tracing.
wavs/55.wav|So a chip, and there are 3 ,000 chip companies in the world, taping out a chip is like $100 million, $50 million, $30 million, depending on the size, but nothing less than $10 million.
wavs/56.wav|As a company, our first priority is to make sure that we're as resilient as possible.
wavs/57.wav|Everyone is a programmer now.
wavs/58.wav|And there was quite a bit of debate about what is the future of computing and how should software be run.
wavs/59.wav|And now 150 million people are programming the computer instead of programming the computer with C or Python.
wavs/60.wav|If you take a look at how much it cost to design a chip, so you put that in perspective, it costs us about $2 to $3 billion to design A100.
wavs/61.wav|And at some point, the positive feedback system starts to work.
wavs/62.wav|And so I think we're going to be just fine in the ability to serve the customers there.
wavs/63.wav|We increased the performance by probably a factor of five.
wavs/64.wav|And so every now and then, a technology revolution comes along. We were started in the PC revolution. After that, the internet revolution came.
wavs/65.wav|We invented the GPU and programmable shader 25 years ago, a quarter of a century ago.
wavs/66.wav|And so there's a fundamental reason that makes a new computing architecture successful.
wavs/67.wav|And then the cloud computing revolution came.
wavs/68.wav|Well, our ambition was always to be a computing platform company.
wavs/69.wav|And so I think this is for so long as I believe I could do that and I don't know exactly how long that's going to be but three or four decades I would say.
wavs/70.wav|And, you know, today all of our AI experiences are related to digital.
wavs/71.wav|But we always believed that accelerated computing was going to be impactful for many, many different industries.
wavs/72.wav|And all of a sudden, the companies before it, some of them didn't make it to the revolution.
wavs/73.wav|Everything that we build is rather singular.
wavs/74.wav|And the markets that we serve aren't commodity markets.
wavs/75.wav|And we changed the company from the bottom all the way to the top and sideways.
wavs/76.wav|And there was a large camp, and rightfully so, that believed that CPU or general purpose software was the best way to go. And it was the best way to go for a long time.
wavs/77.wav|Well, you know, every company makes mistakes. And I make a lot of them.
wavs/78.wav|Well, it turns out it doesn't cost that much.
wavs/79.wav|The thing that's really amazing about artificial intelligence is that what chat GPT has shown is that it has eliminated the digital and the technology divide.
wavs/80.wav|They're now probably over a billion gamers in the world, but they're 8 billion people.
wavs/81.wav|Meanwhile, our financial performance wasn't very good.
wavs/82.wav|And so almost everything is starting to get better.
wavs/83.wav|And we just believed that someday something new would happen. The rest of it is it requires some serendipity.
wavs/84.wav|And now AI is about to be used to revolutionize digital biology and genomics and transportation and retail and all these different industries.
wavs/85.wav|You can't ignore the incredible vision and dedication to the work at open AI.
wavs/86.wav|And the move that they made recently in building the Fab in Arizona is a very big deal. Oh, absolutely. We'll use Arizona. Yeah, absolutely.
wavs/87.wav|And, you know, when you invent something new, you have to convince customers to use it. You have to convince the ecosystem is the right thing to use.
wavs/88.wav|And you hear about cucumber farmers who are teaching a robot how to sort cucumbers, and a high school student did that for his mom.
wavs/89.wav|And we're barely, we barely know exactly what we're doing.
wavs/90.wav|So on the one hand, we're incredibly technology rich.
wavs/91.wav|The foresight was making this architecture exactly the same for everybody.
wavs/92.wav|And we're still in that journey, and frankly, probably early in that journey.
wavs/93.wav|And or much more energy efficient than before.
wavs/94.wav|We expanded from video games into design.
wavs/95.wav|There's no question that the interest behind chat GPT has been so great.
wavs/96.wav|You know, right now, more than any time, the investment needed in AI is just off the charts.
wavs/97.wav|It is imperative upon ourselves and them also invest in diversity and redundancy.
wavs/98.wav|And, you know, some of them puts the company in peril, especially in the beginning, because we were small and we're up against very, very large companies. And we're trying to invent this brand new technology.
wavs/99.wav|And each one of these revolutions and generations of technology.
wavs/100.wav|If you're pioneering one of the most important computing platforms in the world from use for scientific computing to genomics to digital biology all the way to video games, well, you're going to need incredible computer scientists.
wavs/101.wav|And so, so I try to make sure that the company remembers our learnings from the mistakes.
wavs/102.wav|Someday, everybody's going to be a gamer, and it's going to be the largest, by far, entertainment industry.
wavs/103.wav|We felt, however, that there was a class of applications that wouldn't be possible without acceleration.
wavs/104.wav|And you're supercharged by the AI supercomputer and the algorithms that you have inside and all the data that you're going to teach it with.
wavs/105.wav|You know, they just ask coaches, tell you, don't worry about the last down, worry about the next down.
wavs/106.wav|Now each one of those languages that was Oc, and these are really weird languages, and they're hard to learn.
wavs/107.wav|Well, at the time, if you go back 30 years, at the time the PC revolution was just starting, the microprocessor was starting to take off, the CPU was starting to take off.
wavs/108.wav|We're in every country and every field of science.
wavs/109.wav|And so I'm really excited about the progress there.
wavs/110.wav|You're now programming the computer with anybody's plain language, and you tell this computer what you want to do, and this computer goes off and does it.
wavs/111.wav|You know, in another four decades I'll be robotic and maybe another three or four decades after that and so hopefully I'll get to enjoy this for a very long time.
wavs/112.wav|Generative AI, this is the moment that we've all been working for in the last 10 years.
wavs/113.wav|35 ,000 companies use our AI computers to develop and advance this field.
wavs/114.wav|You can't afford to have hotels that are occupied 30%.
wavs/115.wav|And so they have the ability to use all the various fabs for the masks that we have.
wavs/116.wav|I think we're starting to have a lot less inventory and channels and the industry has more capacity and more flexibility.
wavs/117.wav|And today, just about every product that's designed or every digital asset or movie or, you know, almost anything that's designed in 2D or 3D digitally uses Nvidia somehow.
wavs/118.wav|And in every area that we can to be as resilient through diversity and redundancy as much as we can.
wavs/119.wav|And all of the environmental conditions feel exactly the same way, just larger and much, much more industries.
wavs/120.wav|They keep me inspired and I feel that we could do great things together and they give me so much confidence in what we can do and the impact we can make.
wavs/121.wav|And so it's really quite a transformation in how startups are going to get built in the future.
wavs/122.wav|The fact of the matter is TSMC is a really important company. This is a really special company.
wavs/123.wav|Well, the first thing that everybody should do is to take advantage of the technology and to boost their own capability.
wavs/124.wav|And now you could build something like a large language model like a chat GPT for something like $10 million, $20 million. That's really, really affordable.
wavs/125.wav|And so early on, you know, there are product mistakes that we made.
wavs/126.wav|And of course, in research even longer than that, I'm incredibly proud of the work that they've done. Yeah, really terrific team. There's more. Come get them. Everybody should win. Winners to all.
wavs/127.wav|And so these are really, really accessible technologies now.
wavs/128.wav|I'm surrounded by amazing people.
wavs/129.wav|The first thing that I would say is that every data center in the world should accelerate every workload they can.
wavs/130.wav|And the reason for that is because, as you know, the world's data centers consume a lot of power now.
wavs/131.wav|And then at some point it achieves a bit of a escape velocity and it becomes exponential because these applications start to be enabled by you and they come and discover you.
wavs/132.wav|And so we created this thing called accelerated computing.
wavs/133.wav|And then all of a sudden one day, a new application that wasn't possible before discovers you.
wavs/134.wav|And you've got developers, you know, we're a computing company. So developers matter a lot to us. And so we're trying to invent something new.
wavs/135.wav|But now that's changed, that has ended.
wavs/136.wav|But the part that was really wonderful was when we realized that AlexNet is not just some neural network, but it's a whole new way of doing software.
wavs/137.wav|It was computer graphics, and we applied it to video games.
wavs/138.wav|And then all the things that we did to create large systems and networks, which then became this thing called an AI supercomputer.
wavs/139.wav|And the next 25 years, because of what we did, I think we have 25 years of amazing future.
wavs/140.wav|Well, it wasn't foresight. The foresight was accelerated computing.
wavs/141.wav|And we smartly chose one particular combination that was a home run.
wavs/142.wav|In the past, when you started a company, a software company, or a technology company, you need a lot of software engineers.
wavs/143.wav|Or computer graphics and play video games and such.
wavs/144.wav|About five years ago, we came to the conclusion that in order for us to take computer graphics and video games to the next level, we had to reinvent and disrupt ourselves, change literally what we invented altogether.
wavs/145.wav|Imagine a jigsaw puzzle and we gave you one out of eight pieces and somehow the AI filled in the rest. Pretty amazing.
wavs/146.wav|The next generation of AI and where AI meets $100 trillion of the world's industry, that's in the physical world.
wavs/147.wav|All of the software that we wanted to write that we didn't know how to write, we can now do. And that was a great decision.
wavs/148.wav|It's in software, it's information, it's all digital related AI.
wavs/149.wav|The first thing that we should do is every data center in the world, however you decide to do it, for the goodness of sustainable computing, accelerate everything you can.
wavs/150.wav|And so we invented this new way of doing computer graphics, ray tracing and basically simulating the pathways of light and simulating everything with generative AI.
wavs/151.wav|You know, so when you're doing something that's never been done before, you're not exactly sure what you're doing.
wavs/152.wav|And so I think the lesson there is, you know, focus on doing your good work and things will work out for itself.
wavs/153.wav|We're now in every cloud.
wavs/154.wav|Or you couldn't make it affordable enough for everybody to enjoy without acceleration.
wavs/155.wav|And yet, on the other hand, you have these giant companies who would like you not to disrupt the industry.
wavs/156.wav|Now $100 million is when you put that in the cloud and shared by 100 companies, it's almost nothing.
wavs/157.wav|And we reached out to research universities all over the world.
wavs/158.wav|And so we try to engineer and design into everything that we do, diversity and redundancy.
wavs/159.wav|And so that was very, very challenging to have your foot on the gas and your foot on the brakes at exactly the same time and full pressure on both.
wavs/160.wav|I'm really pleased with how we've democratized the technology so that anybody can access it.
wavs/161.wav|And so each one of these transitions, it's very unlikely that the companies that were great before it are still great after it.
wavs/162.wav|They're the heaviest computers that humans make. And it's complicated. It's got tens of thousands of unique parts.
wavs/163.wav|Well, we're in a really fast moving industry.
wavs/164.wav|And that led us to a much more general purpose type of accelerated computing that we created, which then one day, artificial intelligence found us.
wavs/165.wav|And the world doesn't have more than one of them.
wavs/166.wav|And so we compute one pixel and we imagine with AI the other seven.
wavs/167.wav|And one of the things that I'm really proud about our company is, at the core of our company is incredible technology. We have incredible technologists.
wavs/168.wav|Well, I guess it's like five, six years ago, I guess, five years ago. Yeah.
wavs/169.wav|The next big reinvention is probably where AI meets the physical world.
wavs/170.wav|And so it could be transportation, it could be robotic surgery, it could be warehouses and manufacturing plants and energy plants and fabrication plants and so on and so forth.
wavs/171.wav|And the reason why there are so many CEOs with bragging rights on so many A100s is because it's really quite democratized.
wavs/172.wav|A100 was replaced by H100, which we're in full production now.
wavs/173.wav|The thing that's really great about TSMC is every mask runs everywhere.
wavs/174.wav|And that combination turned out to have been a giant industry, and now video games is the largest industry in the world, and the largest entertainment industry in the world.
wavs/175.wav|It feels very much like the iPhone moment when mobile cloud really took off.
wavs/176.wav|I'm really happy with the diffusion of the technology.
wavs/177.wav|They're in all kinds of areas, consumer internet to digital biology to robotics.
wavs/178.wav|We stay ahead by number one, doing it very well, but also we do it very differently.
wavs/179.wav|And so we made a lot of great decisions.
wavs/180.wav|They weigh 350 pounds per computer.
wavs/181.wav|While NVIDIA's technology is export control, it's a reflection of the importance of the technology that we make. The first thing that we have to do is comply with the regulations.
wavs/182.wav|It's really quite amazing.
wavs/183.wav|We built a wonderful research organization dedicated to artificial intelligence.
wavs/184.wav|And, you know, one of the skills of resilience is the ability to forget the past.
wavs/185.wav|We had to reinvent ourselves in each one of those technology revolutions.
wavs/186.wav|You know, first you discover them and then pretty soon they discover you.
wavs/187.wav|And there are so many great companies in the world and we're pursuing very similar aspirations. We want to solve the world's greatest challenges.
wavs/188.wav|Or another way to think about that, we reduced the amount of energy consumed by a factor of five.
wavs/189.wav|All the work that we do with AI super computing and RTX ray tracing and all of that came out during this time.
wavs/190.wav|Everybody could program a computer.
wavs/191.wav|On the other hand, we're in enormous, you know, we're in a giant sea of technology companies.
wavs/192.wav|And that was what we pioneered about three decades ago. And it's taken until now to really take off.
wavs/193.wav|And then the mobile cloud computing revolution came. And now we're talking about the AI revolution.
wavs/194.wav|So our TCO, our cost, is actually the lowest of all.
wavs/195.wav|Or you tell the computer you like to write a Python script, and it goes off and does it.
wavs/196.wav|And we're moving nicely into the next generation nodes.
wavs/197.wav|It's definitely a watershed event for the AI industry.
wavs/198.wav|In the beginning, there weren't that many applications for it, frankly.
wavs/199.wav|And so the ability for us to adapt and reinvent ourselves and continue to be relevant from one generation to another generation was really important. And I'm very proud of that.
wavs/200.wav|There were, you know, execution challenges that we had. There were some strategy mistakes that I made. And, you know, there's just so many of them.
wavs/201.wav|Now we're onto something even larger than that, built on these AI supercomputers, these large language models.
wavs/202.wav|And this positive feedback system starts to defeat on itself.
wavs/203.wav|Maybe you made it possible for you to keep the computer with you all the time, mobile cloud.
wavs/204.wav|And that's the reason why people use it, because they can use it on so many things. The second reason is we're in every cloud.
wavs/205.wav|And so our ability to be flexible, versatile, and also extremely performant, lets us increase the versatility and the utility, the utilization of it inside a data center.
wavs/206.wav|Every chip that we made was focused on artificial intelligence.
wavs/207.wav|And so I think every domain expert in the world will be able to do that.
wavs/208.wav|When I hit Enter and ask TSMC to help us make it, that email is $100 million.
wavs/209.wav|And the great decisions associated with the architecture and discipline of the platform and evangelizing it to everybody.
wavs/210.wav|And so I'm excited about the investments that they're making so that the entire world can count on them for diversity and redundancy. Yeah, it's a really special company.
wavs/211.wav|Giant companies like cloud and internet companies all the way to startups, thousands of startups.
wavs/212.wav|And so that great invention completely revolutionized video games.
wavs/213.wav|And it used to be the case that because of Moore's law, even though we required more computing throughput every year, the amount of power that the world's data centers consume didn't grow that fast.
wavs/214.wav|You have a vision about what you want to create and for whatever reason, you differentiate in your computing approach.
wavs/215.wav|And agility is just really, really, really important to companies.
wavs/216.wav|And I feel that I'm making a real contribution to the company and to them and to create an environment where we can make, you know, really amazing contributions.
wavs/217.wav|So we could, on the one hand, simulate climate science, on the other hand, do robotics, on the other hand, do large language models.
wavs/218.wav|And it drove our technology for three decades, because making video games more and more realistic, making it available to more people, took a long time.
wavs/219.wav|You know, you reach now a lot of different customers and different applications, where in every cloud made by every computer company.
wavs/220.wav|And semiconductor design tools, the manufacturing of our chips, packaging, memory systems, the systems that we build AI supercomputers, these things are like cars.
wavs/221.wav|And there are some companies that have made the ability to, because of their adaptability and agility, reinvented themselves along the way.
wavs/222.wav|It is the fastest growing application in the world, and it's been used in all kinds of different ways.
wavs/223.wav|And maybe you made it super convenient in the cloud.
