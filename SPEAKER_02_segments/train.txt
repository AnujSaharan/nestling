wavs/6.wav|Which says, I believe the excuse, using the excuse of look at the advantage of the competition instead of thinking, what could I improve isn't exactly productive. What are we supposed to improve?
wavs/7.wav|No, no, I think this is from the other side. Oh, okay. Yeah.
wavs/8.wav|I can't remember this meeting because we've gone through this. Then we recovered.
wavs/9.wav|It's, yeah, it's, it's hard for everyone. It's not easy. And YouTube is constantly changing the rules. I mean, I express frustration as well.
wavs/10.wav|But we also fought tooth and nail for every part of it.
wavs/11.wav|I think that was over a span of about four months. Yeah. It was about three months. Terrifying. I thought that was it.
wavs/12.wav|So what I should prioritize an external smaller creator over an internal smaller creator. It was like, how would. Yeah. I mean, here, Luke was talking about dips. I don't know how well you guys can see this from there. Yeah, not too well. You know what?
wavs/13.wav|Like we, we shifted advertising budgets from written media and forums and like traditional legacy magazines. TV ads.
wavs/14.wav|And that dip is as dangerous to us as it is to you as an organization.
wavs/15.wav|I think that was, we, we, I can't remember because here's the thing.
wavs/16.wav|What is it about our size that's problematic, I guess would be my question.
wavs/17.wav|Then we had another two months ball dip where we went from like four million views a day down to like two in a little bit. Then we came back hard.
wavs/18.wav|I've talked about how I think it's harder to become a mega -sized channel and Mr.
wavs/19.wav|So I don't know, maybe I don't, I, I feel like this is one of those responses that's going to turn into some kind of controversy because I just, I'm uncaring or like I'm some kind of jerk or something, but I don't know what to tell you.
wavs/20.wav|But we've also, we've also taken a lot of risks along the way.
wavs/21.wav|I'll send, I'll send emails to our rep saying like, Hey, we're really for sure not doing anything differently, but we're seeing very different results. What are you guys doing over there? And it goes both ways.
wavs/22.wav|This distresses me as much as a dip because I don't like unpredictability in the delivery of our content.
wavs/23.wav|Uh, we, we, we have legitimized advertising in the tech YouTuber space. You're welcome.
wavs/24.wav|Like, yes, we have an advantage, but are you going to say we didn't fight for it?
wavs/25.wav|And, and I think that's a benefit to creators, small and large, you know, when we talk about things like how our revenue is broken down.
wavs/26.wav|And so you can see here, hockey stick moment.
wavs/27.wav|But I would also like to point out that we've become a very big ship and we've become kind of difficult to steer.
wavs/28.wav|Then we had a long period, about a year of constant digging ourselves out of that.
wavs/29.wav|We've increased the, the, the minimum threshold by hiring so many people, by aggressively reinvesting in content to the point where, you know, again, I'm not going to, I'm not going to apologize for it.
wavs/30.wav|And I don't just mean this as like, look how out of touch and arrogant Linus is, but no, for real.
wavs/31.wav|Um, I think that in some ways it's easier than ever to break out on YouTube, to be discovered. In some ways it's harder.
wavs/32.wav|I'm never going to, I'm never going to try to do anything other than my best.
wavs/33.wav|And when something breaking happens, who's the first one on top of it?
wavs/34.wav|I'm not gonna, yeah, I'm not going to apologize for, for, you know, killing it, um, over the years.
wavs/35.wav|From many of the brand partners that these smaller tech creators are working with today, we fought through that, getting it reallocated to YouTube and everyone now gets to enjoy the fruit of that.
wavs/36.wav|That's the kind of stuff we don't have to talk about, but we do.
wavs/37.wav|Like I've, you know, got the house and the car, you know, like, all right, cool. Barbecue.
wavs/38.wav|And we got a little lucky. Right place, right time.
wavs/39.wav|We have to change and we need to start changing things immediately. Like for today's upload, we need to start changing things.
wavs/40.wav|Then we went from like four million views a day down to like two again. And then now we're on an upswing.
wavs/41.wav|That was when I started focusing on content after we hired Nick as our like business guy.
wavs/42.wav|But there's a lot of other people here that still got to, still got to get some. And so we're not going to take our foot off the pedal.
wavs/43.wav|That's got us now in the neighborhood of around like three and a half million views a day.
wavs/44.wav|If someone sees that and goes, Holy smokes, like I am doing basically none of this and it's 20 % of their revenue. I need to, I could chase that.
wavs/45.wav|Like I sent one a few months back that I was like, Hey, everything's coming real easy right now. What's going on?
wavs/46.wav|And you got to like, views aren't everything, but they also kind of are because everything else is derived from how many views you can ultimately attract.
wavs/47.wav|Who's the Boss is the only evidence I've seen in recent years that you can even still do it at all. Absolutely did it.
wavs/48.wav|And that's one of the things that we're trying to address is because it can be a competitive disadvantage for us to be a jack of all trades, master of none sometimes.
wavs/49.wav|I mean, we've, we've, yeah, we were very open about the way that we run our business.
wavs/50.wav|Maybe not as dangerous to me personally, because I've, I've been doing this for a really long time.
wavs/51.wav|We weren't the only ones, not even a little bit, but we were very much the tip of the spear.
wavs/52.wav|So, you know, this is our view chart over the entire lifetime of the channel. Right.
